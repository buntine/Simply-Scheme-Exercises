; In the language APL, most arithmetic functions can be applied either to a number,
; with the usual result, or to a vector —the APL name for a sentence of numbers—in which
; case the result is a new vector in which each element is the result of applying the function
; to the corresponding element of the argument. For example, the function sqrt applied
; to 16 returns 4 as in Scheme, but sqrt can also be applied to a sentence such as (16 49)
; and it returns (4 7).
;
; Write a procedure aplize that takes as its argument a one-argument procedure whose
; domain is numbers or words. It should return an APLized procedure that also accepts
; sentences:
;
; > (define apl-sqrt (aplize sqrt))
; > (apl-sqrt 36)
; 6
;
; > (apl-sqrt ’(1 100 25 16))
; (1 10 5 4)

(define (aplize f)
  (lambda (n)
    (if (sentence? n)
      (every f n)
      (f n))))
